[Deep Learning: Feedforward Neural Networks Explain](https://medium.com/hackernoon/deep-learning-feedforward-neural-networks-explained-c34ae3f084f1)

Feedforward neural networks AKA Multi-layered Network of Neurons (MLN)

They are called feedforward because there information only travels forward in the network.
From the input nodes -> Hidden layers (1 or many) -> output nodes.

In MLN there are no feedback connection such that the output of a node is also it's input (the output is *fed* back into itself).

These networks are represented by a combination of many simpler models (sigmoid neurons).
