This file will convert the html from ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com into a readable format.

The idea is that it will begin as only raw html and slowly convert it into a more readable format until it slowly is human readable/parsable format.

afterwards we'll convert part by part into a pretty format. (backlinks will be added through as navigation stack)

at the beginning perhaps we will have each page as its own clickable button and we can slowly parse all the files

we will have json (or perhaps sqlite?)
